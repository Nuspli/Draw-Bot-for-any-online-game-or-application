# Draw-Bot-for-any-online-game-or-application
works on anything with a canvas, a constant brush size and and colors

for eg:
* skribbl.io
* gartic phone, gartic.io
* sketchful.io
* ms paint

features:
* outline drawing with lines
* colored dithering
* black and white dithering
* quantized drawing for faster times (color by color or line by line)
* settings for colors, brushsize, speed and drawing area
* uses image URL

run it via cmd or in your python ide and it should install all the requirements on its own\
make sure to calibrate it before drawing by selecting settings (first 2 are most important)\
if any emergencies occour, press "q" to trigger the failsafe

not the prettiest, but I belive the believe the fastest and most versitile one out there
and once you get used to it, it's also very easy to use

I also recommend using clipart images for faster drawing times (not necessary for dithering)
